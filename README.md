# cct_soundsystem_spaghetti
pllist creates the playlist
sound system does not have autofill and was entirely made by lots of screeming at chatgpt 3 on the free tier
starup.lua is for running the playlist on startup but will only work if you run pllist.lua if you upload startup.lua to the cc tweaked computer before generateing a playlist it will be thrown into a boot loop
told you it was spaghetti code the only good thing in here is the audio handling which makes it the only reason why this code is worth putting on GitHub so people can borrow that code 
literally everything else only allows for one speaker i am only posting this so people can yoink the code
chatgpt somehow made a working gui for the soundsystem.lua file also from telling the ai that it eats too much stupid but it works 
feel free to borrow any and all of this code seriously please


i don't think it borrowed too much code as i had to spit lots of documentation at it in order to have it even understand what a cc tweaked was so the code should be mostly original garbage even though it does work perfictly its trash perfict trash.
