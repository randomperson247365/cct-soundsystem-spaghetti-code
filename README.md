# cct_soundsystem_spaghetti
pllist creates the playlist
sound system does not have autofill and was entirely made by chatgpt 3 on the free tier
starup.lua is for running the playlist on startup but will only work if you run pllist.lua
told you it was spaghetti code the only good thing in here is the audio handling which makes it the only reason why this code is worth putting on GitHub so people can borrow that code 
literally everything else only allows for one speaker i am only posting this so people can yoink the code
